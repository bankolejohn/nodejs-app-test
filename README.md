# Node.js App with PostgreSQL and Docker

This project is a simple Node.js application that demonstrates how to build a modern web application with a PostgreSQL database, Docker, and DevOps best practices. It includes features for adding and deleting users, making it a great example of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

## **Business Value**

In today’s fast-paced digital world, businesses rely on scalable, maintainable, and efficient web applications to deliver value to their customers. This project demonstrates how modern technologies like **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker** can be combined to build robust applications that meet these demands.

### **Key Benefits:**
1. **Scalability**: The use of Docker allows the application to be easily scaled horizontally to handle increased traffic.
2. **Portability**: Docker ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, from development to production.
3. **Efficiency**: Node.js provides a lightweight and fast runtime, while PostgreSQL offers a reliable and performant database solution.
4. **DevOps Integration**: The project is designed with DevOps principles in mind, enabling continuous integration, delivery, and deployment (CI/CD).

This project is particularly useful for:
- **Startups**: Quickly build and deploy scalable web applications.
- **DevOps Engineers**: Demonstrate best practices for containerization and deployment.
- **Developers**: Learn how to integrate modern technologies into a full-stack application.

## **Features**

- **Add Users**: A simple form to add users to the database.
- **List Users**: Display all users in the database.
- **Delete Users**: Remove users from the database with a single click.
- **Docker Support**: The application and database are containerized using Docker.
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration using `.env` files.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database.
- **Sequelize**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Node.js to interact with PostgreSQL.
- **Docker**: A platform for containerizing applications and services.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **dotenv**: A module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

---

## **Architecture**

The application follows a **3-tier architecture**:
1. **Presentation Layer**: The frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) interacts with the user.
2. **Application Layer**: The Node.js backend handles business logic and communicates with the database.
3. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL stores and manages the application data.

### **Docker Architecture**
- **Node.js App**: Runs in a Docker container.
- **PostgreSQL**: Runs in a separate Docker container.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages the multi-container setup.

---

## **Setup and Deployment**

### **Prerequisites**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Node.js (optional, for local development without Docker).

### **Steps to Run the Application**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

Set Up Environment Variables:

2. **Create a .env file in the root directory**:
    ```bash
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@db:5432/your_db_name
    PORT=3000
    ```

3. **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. **Access the Application**:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.


## **DevOps Integration**

As a DevOps engineer, you can extend this project to include CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and infrastructure as code (IaC). Here are some suggestions:

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
- Use **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins** to automate testing and deployment.
- Build and push Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

### **Monitoring**
- Integrate **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring application performance.
- Use **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- Use **Terraform** or **AWS CloudFormation** to provision infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS databases).

### **Container Orchestration**
- Deploy the application to **Kubernetes** for advanced container orchestration and scaling.
